<h1>The best Shows & Animes according to Raksha</h1>
<h2>Last week 3 series recommendation.</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Law and Order Special Victim Unit</h2>
<p>
  It's a series about NYPD assigned a special unit for sexual harrasment &
  crime. I think the series was intresting and fascinating to know about people
  or you could even how psychopath some people can be
</p>

<h2>Malcom in the middle</h2>
<p>
  This sitcom is really fun after the middle. It's a about who is super genius
  and his hilariious.
</p>

<h2>I'll become a villaness who goes down in the history</h2>
<p>
  Man this is the best anime in the longest time I have watched. I like
  villaness and time travel animes more than the so according to me its 100/10.
